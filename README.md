# dictation-toolbox
Meta-repository for tracking and providing information about the organization
itself.

## Summary

dictation-toolbox is a loose organization intended to organize projects for
users of voice recognition software, with a focus on customizability,
flexibility, and programming/system administration/etc. We hope to help fill in
the gap between commercially available solutions for common workflows and other
workflows which require customization.

We also intend to provide a contingency plan for projects to be "adopted" by
new maintainers if their current maintainers leave without transferring control
of the project. Each repository in dictation-toolbox has one or more owners
responsible for it, and admins of dictation-toolbox agree not to use their
admin privileges on repositories where they are not an owner, except in the
case of all owners dropping out of all contact for four months.

We are open to including other projects under these terms to better serve the
needs of the dictation community. Please open an issue in this repository if
you are interested. Historically, we have made all owners of all repositories
in dictation-toolbox admins of the organization.

## Projects

The listed owners of each project, rather than the admins of dictation-toolbox,
retain full control and responsibility for all aspects of their project.
